Simple. Useful. Efficient & Free forever.

## Why

Nova.css is a cool, fun and cross-browser effect set so you can use them in your web and mobile projects as [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/). Ideal for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and adding water in general. 

## Download
You can get it on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

`npm install nova.css --save`

Or if you're not into package management, just [Download a Zip](https://github.com/agazinakou/Nova/archive/master.zip) file. 


## Setup
First, include the script located on the dist folder.

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/nova.min.css">`
        

## How To Use
Nova.css is simple to use just add the class name of the effect to the element to which you want it to apply. For example if I want to use the pulse effect `nv-back-pulse`

`<a href="" class="button nv-back-pulse"></a>`

## Browser Support

The good news is that nova.css gracefully degrades if you need to support older browsers.
